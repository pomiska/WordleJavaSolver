# (Manual) Wordle Java Solver
Java program that I botched together in an hour, used to solve the words in Wordle (https://www.nytimes.com/games/wordle). Relies on user input, has bugs, no GUI. But hey, it gets the words correct. I might make it actually usable in the future.

The first 10 words tested (from Wordle Archive https://metzger.media/games/wordle-archive/) showed average 3.6/6 tries and 100% success rate. Of course in such a small sample size luck is also a factor.
